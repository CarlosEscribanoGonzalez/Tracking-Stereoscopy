# Tracking and Stereoscopy

This project is a **tracking and stereoscopy exercise** developed in **C++** using the **ArUco libraries**, created for the course **Virtual Reality** during my third year of university.

### About the Project

The objective of this practice was to use QR codes to move and rotate the camera in a virtual scene by tracking them through the webcam. Additionally, a stereoscopy filter can be activated within the virtual scene to enhance the 3D experience.

### Features
- Camera movement and rotation using QR code tracking via **ArUco**.
- Stereoscopy filter activation for 3D visualization.
- Developed in **C++**.

### Technologies
- **C++**
- **ArUco libraries**
